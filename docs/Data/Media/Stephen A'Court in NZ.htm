<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Dad, Below is part of the e-mail Stephen sent to 
you, as you see he says he believes his grandfather John Augustus A'Court was 
born in England about 1899.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I have searched the 1901 UK&nbsp;census for a John 
(second names are rarely recorded on census returns) and there are none that fit 
age wise.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>However for St.Heliers, Jersey CI, there is a John 
age 3 son of John F A'Court and Ester, born St Heliers. which is interesting as 
Stephen mentions the Channel Islands.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Although Jersey is so close to France the A'Court 
family there almost certainly go back to George A'Court born about 1825 Castle 
Cary. Somerset.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2><U>If</U> this is Stephens family he may be 
interested to know that John F 's father Henry John A'Court was at one time the 
Master of the Cutty Sark, I have a copy of a press cutting about him, with a 
portrait which I could forward.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>The two other alternatives are that</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;(1)Stephens grandfather was not counted on 
the census.or</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>(2) had already left the Uk for NZ</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I would be very interested to hear of any more 
details, from his Aunt Beryl perhaps.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>do feel free to forward this a-mail on to Stephen 
if it helps.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>Cheers Ian</FONT></DIV>

<DIV>I wonder if we're related Clem? Probably, with such an unusual surname 
(well, it's uncommon in NZ and I'm assuming it's the same where you are). I know 
less about my father's family than I ought. My father, John Stephen A'Court was 
born in NZ in 1929. His father, John Augustus A'Court was born in England in 
1899 or 1900, I believe. My father is one of six children. We understand that 
our surname was originally French. I believe there are several families with the 
name living in the English channel islands, which I guess is not so far from 
you. </DIV></BODY></HTML>
